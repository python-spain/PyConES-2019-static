&lt;p&gt;Since the first edition we have always had the aim that no one will be left out of going to the PyConES for economic reasons, and one more year we have the support of the &lt;strong&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;, which has granted us &lt;strong&gt;4000 â‚¬&lt;/strong&gt; of funding for this financial aid program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to profit from this grant program, you must send an application to contact+finaid@2019.es.pycon.org which includes a brief presentation, a description of why you want to come to the PyConES 2019 and the amount requested and justified (travel, stay...). During the following days after the deadline, the organizing committee will evaluate all the submissions, and those that have been accepted may be subsidized totally or partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last day to send the application is June 28, &lt;a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will take several factors into account during the distribution of the funds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the applicant is a speaker at the conference (talk or workshop),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial situation of the person (prioritizing people without income, such as students, unemployed or academic staff with no funding),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distance to travel (prioritizing people coming from far away), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demonstrated an effort to optimize costs (search for cheaper transport or accommodation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the committee's decision has been published, we will inform the applicants of the total amount that was accepted. Expenses will be refunded mainly by bank transfer once the applicants submit the corresponding invoices and tickets, before, during or after the conference. We commit ourselves to make the refunds before the end of the year. If necessary, we can also anticipate the payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We appreciate the widest possible diffusion of this information in order to reach the people who need it the most!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frequently Not Asked Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I don't think I'm worth the financial aid / other people are worth it more than I am, is it worth it to apply?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;. It is the committee that assesses how to distribute the aid :)&lt;/p&gt;
